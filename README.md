Evenite
=======

No more tedious javascripts to select invitees. Invite all friends in a
friend list or network to a Facebook event from the comfort of your terminal.

Some of the HTTPServer code based on an example by
[Paul Cardener](http://blog.carduner.net/2010/05/26/authenticating-with-facebook-on-the-command-line-using-python/).

Usage

    python evenite.py
